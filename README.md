# url-Shorten-It-JS
# About The Project

Users should be able to:
1. View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size. 2. See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.
3. Shorten any valid URL.
4. Copy the shortened link to their clipboard in a single click.
5. Receive an error message when the form is submitted if the input field is empty.
6. See a list of their shortened links, even after refreshing the browser.
I do not have access to the Figma sketch so the design is not pixel perfect.

# Built with
